<h1>Active Directory User and Group Management</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/1By0q2EAf9I)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I demonstrated my ability to manage users, groups, and permissions within an Active Directory (AD) environment. I created Organizational Units (OUs) for different departments, including HR, IT, and Finance, and added multiple user accounts to each OU. I also built security groups such as "HR Managers," "IT Admins," and "Finance Users," assigning appropriate permissions using Group Policy Management.
